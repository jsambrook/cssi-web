        id="introduction-the-power-of-practicing-what-we-preach">Introduction:
        The Power of Practicing What We Preach</h2>
        <p>In the tech world, there’s a peculiar phrase that gets tossed
        around in product development circles: “eating your own
        dogfood.” While it might sound unappetizing at first, this
        concept represents one of the most powerful quality assurance
        strategies a technology company can employ. At Common Sense
        Systems, we don’t just talk about this practice—we live it every
        day.</p>
        <p>Dogfooding, as it’s commonly known, refers to the practice of
        using your own products internally before releasing them to
        customers. It’s about being your own first and most demanding
        customer. This approach forces us to experience our software
        exactly as our clients do, revealing pain points, usability
        issues, and opportunities for improvement that might otherwise
        go unnoticed until after release.</p>
        <p>But why is this practice so critical to our success and, more
        importantly, to the success of our clients? In this article,
        we’ll explore how our commitment to using our own tools has
        shaped our development process, improved our products, and
        ultimately delivered better results for the businesses we
        serve.</p>
        <h2 id="what-does-eating-your-own-dogfood-really-mean">What Does
        “Eating Your Own Dogfood” Really Mean?</h2>
        <h3 id="the-origin-of-an-unusual-term">The Origin of an Unusual
        Term</h3>
        <p>The term “eating your own dogfood” has an interesting history
        in the tech industry. It reportedly originated in the 1980s when
        a Microsoft executive wrote a memo titled “Eating Our Own
        Dogfood,” encouraging employees to use the company’s products
        internally. The metaphor stuck, and for good reason—if you
        wouldn’t feed your dog something you wouldn’t eat yourself, why
        would you expect customers to use products you wouldn’t?</p>
        <h3
        id="beyond-testing-a-philosophy-of-product-development">Beyond
        Testing: A Philosophy of Product Development</h3>
        <p>At Common Sense Systems, dogfooding goes far beyond basic
        quality assurance testing. It represents a fundamental
        philosophy about how we approach product development:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>Authentic user experience</strong>: We become real
        users, not just developers or testers</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous feedback loop</strong>: Daily use
        provides constant opportunities for improvement</li>
        <li><strong>Skin in the game</strong>: Our team feels personally
        invested in fixing issues quickly</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural alignment</strong>: Everyone understands
        that quality isn’t just a department—it’s a mindset</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As our CEO often says, “We don’t build software we wouldn’t
        stake our own business on.” This commitment means that every
        feature, interface, and workflow in our products has been
        battle-tested in real-world scenarios before it ever reaches our
        clients.</p>
        <h2 id="the-tangible-benefits-of-our-dogfooding-approach">The
        Tangible Benefits of Our Dogfooding Approach</h2>
        <h3 id="catching-issues-before-they-reach-customers">1. Catching
        Issues Before They Reach Customers</h3>
        <p>When we use our own products daily, bugs and usability issues
        have nowhere to hide. In 2024 alone, our internal usage
        identified over 200 potential improvements before they could
        impact our customers. These ranged from minor interface
        inconsistencies to more significant workflow bottlenecks that
        might have caused frustration for users.</p>
        <p>For example, when implementing our new project management
        module, our marketing team discovered that the notification
        system was sending too many alerts for minor updates. This
        feedback led to a complete redesign of our notification
        preferences, allowing for more granular control—a feature our
        customers now consistently rate as one of their favorites.</p>
        <h3 id="building-more-intuitive-products">2. Building More
        Intuitive Products</h3>
        <p>There’s a significant difference between what looks good in
        design mockups and what actually feels intuitive during daily
        use. By relying on our own tools to run our business, we’ve
        developed a heightened sensitivity to user experience
        issues.</p>
        <p>Our customer support team uses our CRM solution to manage all
        client interactions, which led to a complete overhaul of our
        ticket categorization system. What seemed logical in theory
        proved cumbersome in practice, and the redesigned approach now
        saves our team—and our customers—an average of 12 minutes per
        support interaction.</p>
        <h3 id="accelerating-development-cycles">3. Accelerating
        Development Cycles</h3>
        <p>When the people developing the product are also using it
        daily, the feedback loop tightens dramatically. Our development
        team doesn’t have to wait for formal user testing or customer
        complaints to identify issues—they experience them firsthand and
        often fix them immediately.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“The best QA team is a development team that depends on their
        own product to get their work done. Nothing motivates fixes
        faster than personal frustration.” — Our Lead Developer</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This approach has allowed us to reduce our development cycle
        times by approximately 30% compared to industry standards,
        meaning we can deliver improvements and new features to our
        customers faster than ever.</p>
        <h2
        id="how-dogfooding-translates-to-better-customer-experiences">How
        Dogfooding Translates to Better Customer Experiences</h2>
        <h3 id="real-world-problem-solving">Real-World Problem
        Solving</h3>
        <p>Because we use our products in real business scenarios, we
        develop solutions for actual problems rather than hypothetical
        use cases. When we built our automated reporting features, we
        did so because our own management team was spending too much
        time compiling data manually. The resulting solution wasn’t just
        technically sound—it addressed a genuine business need that we
        knew our customers shared.</p>
        <h3 id="documentation-that-actually-makes-sense">Documentation
        That Actually Makes Sense</h3>
        <p>One of the most common complaints about business software is
        poor documentation. When our team writes help content, they do
        so from the perspective of actual users who have encountered the
        same questions and challenges our customers might face. Our
        support tickets related to documentation confusion have
        decreased by 47% since implementing this approach.</p>
        <h3 id="training-that-reflects-real-usage">Training That
        Reflects Real Usage</h3>
        <p>Our customer onboarding and training materials benefit
        tremendously from our dogfooding approach. When we train new
        clients on our systems, we can share authentic examples of how
        we use the software ourselves, including specific workflows,
        shortcuts, and best practices that have emerged from our daily
        usage.</p>
        <p>A client recently told us: “It’s refreshing to get training
        from people who actually use the software every day. The tips
        you shared weren’t in any manual, but they’ve saved us hours of
        work.”</p>
        <h2
        id="case-study-how-dogfooding-transformed-our-project-management-tool">Case
        Study: How Dogfooding Transformed Our Project Management
        Tool</h2>
        <p>To illustrate the impact of our approach, let’s look at a
        specific example from our product lineup: our project management
        solution.</p>
        <h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Initially designed with traditional waterfall project
        methodologies in mind, our tool was structured around linear
        progression through predetermined stages. On paper, it looked
        comprehensive and robust.</p>
        <h3 id="the-reality-check">The Reality Check</h3>
        <p>When our own development team—who follows an agile
        methodology—began using the tool, they immediately encountered
        friction. The rigid structure didn’t accommodate their need for
        sprints, backlog management, and rapid iteration. What’s more,
        they found themselves creating workarounds and using
        supplementary tools to manage their workflow.</p>
        <h3 id="the-transformation">The Transformation</h3>
        <p>Rather than continuing with the original vision, we pivoted
        based on this internal feedback. The development team became the
        primary stakeholders in redesigning the tool, incorporating:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Flexible methodology options (Agile, Waterfall, and hybrid
        approaches)</li>
        <li>Customizable workflows that adapt to different team
        structures</li>
        <li>Integrated backlog management and sprint planning</li>
        <li>Real-time collaboration features inspired by our own remote
        work needs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-results">The Results</h3>
        <p>The redesigned tool not only eliminated the need for our team
        to use multiple solutions but also resonated strongly with our
        customers. Adoption rates increased by 78%, and customer
        satisfaction scores for this product rose from 7.2 to 9.1 out of
        10.</p>
        <p>This example demonstrates how dogfooding prevented us from
        releasing a product that looked good in theory but would have
        failed to meet real-world needs. Instead, we created something
        that genuinely solved problems because we experienced those
        problems ourselves.</p>
        <h2
        id="the-challenges-of-dogfooding-and-how-we-address-them">The
        Challenges of Dogfooding (And How We Address Them)</h2>
        <p>While we’re strong advocates for eating our own dogfood, we
        recognize that this approach comes with certain challenges that
        must be managed carefully.</p>
        <h3 id="avoiding-echo-chamber-effects">1. Avoiding Echo Chamber
        Effects</h3>
        <p>When you’re both the creator and the user, there’s a risk of
        developing tunnel vision based on your specific needs. To
        counter this, we:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Maintain diverse internal user groups with different
        workflows and requirements</li>
        <li>Regularly compare our usage patterns with customer
        analytics</li>
        <li>Conduct external usability testing to complement our
        internal feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="balancing-internal-and-external-priorities">2. Balancing
        Internal and External Priorities</h3>
        <p>Sometimes what our team needs most urgently differs from what
        the broader market requires. We manage this tension by:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Using a weighted scoring system for feature prioritization
        that balances internal needs with market demands</li>
        <li>Maintaining separate development tracks for internal tools
        versus customer-facing features when necessary</li>
        <li>Ensuring product decisions are informed by both internal
        feedback and market research</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="managing-the-disruption-of-updates">3. Managing the
        Disruption of Updates</h3>
        <p>When you’re constantly improving your products, internal
        teams can experience “update fatigue” from frequent changes to
        their tools. We address this by:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Implementing staged rollouts internally before customer
        releases</li>
        <li>Providing comprehensive change management support for our
        own teams</li>
        <li>Collecting structured feedback on how updates impact
        productivity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By acknowledging and addressing these challenges, we ensure
        that our dogfooding practice remains a strength rather than a
        limitation.</p>
        <h2 id="how-our-dogfooding-benefits-you">How Our Dogfooding
        Benefits You</h2>
        <p>As a current or potential customer of Common Sense Systems,
        you might be wondering how our internal practices translate to
        value for your business. Here’s how our commitment to eating our
        own dogfood directly benefits you:</p>

        receive a feature or update, it’s been thoroughly vetted in
        real-world business scenarios.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Practical solutions to real problems</strong>:
        Our products solve genuine business challenges because we’ve
        experienced those challenges ourselves.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Empathetic support</strong>: When you contact our
        support team, you’re speaking with people who use the same tools
        you do and understand your frustrations firsthand.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Continuous improvement</strong>: Our internal
        usage drives constant refinement, meaning the products you use
        get better more quickly than those developed in traditional
        cycles.</p></li>

        we share come from actual experience, not theoretical
        knowledge.</p></li>

        promises, our commitment to eating our own dogfood provides
        something increasingly rare: authenticity. We don’t just claim
        our products can solve business problems—we rely on them to

        <p>If you’re evaluating technology partners, we encourage you to
        ask this simple question: “Do they use their own products?” The
        answer reveals volumes about a company’s confidence in what
        they’re selling and their commitment to quality.</p>
        <p>At Common Sense Systems, the answer is an emphatic yes—we
        wouldn’t have it any other way. And we believe this commitment
        is one of the most valuable things we bring to our client
