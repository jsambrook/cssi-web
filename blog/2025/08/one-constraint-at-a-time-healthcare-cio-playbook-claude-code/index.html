        <h2 id="monday-morning-803-a.m.">Monday Morning, 8:03 a.m.</h2>
        <p>The EMR freezes during morning rounds. Clinicians are locked
        out. Patients wait. Your phone lights up with texts from the
        Chief Medical Officer: “What’s happening? How long?”</p>
        <p>In the IT command channel, the theories fly:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>“SQL Server is thrashing tempdb again — deadlocks are
        spiking.”</li>
        <li>“SAN latency went red — storage headroom is gone.”</li>
        <li>“Active Directory token refresh failed; half the Citrix
        sessions are invalid.”</li>
        <li>“We need to double the VDI hosts — remote access is
        maxed.”</li>
        <li>“If this were on Aurora or CosmosDB, we wouldn’t be dealing
        with this.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A vendor chimes in: “Buy our AIOps platform — it would have
        predicted this outage.”</p>
        <p>They’re all technically valid. But as CIO, you ask yourself:
        <strong>Which one matters most right now?</strong></p>
        <p>That’s the daily reality: dozens of smart people, dozens of
        smart fixes — but limited time, budget, and energy.</p>
        <p>What if you had a way to cut through the noise and
        consistently identify the single constraint that, if fixed,
        moves the whole system forward?</p>
        <h2 id="the-model-that-cuts-through-the-noise">The Model That
        Cuts Through the Noise</h2>
        <p>Engineering leaders call it the <strong>Hierarchy of
        Engineering Needs (HoEN)</strong>. Think of it as Maslow’s
        hierarchy for IT. Before you dream of “flow,” you must shore up
        the basics.</p>
        <p>Here’s how it maps to a hospital IT department:</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="assets/hierarchy-pyramid.png"
        alt="Hierarchy of Engineering Needs for Hospital IT" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Hierarchy of Engineering Needs
        for Hospital IT</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="hierarchy-breakdown">
        <h3 id="flow-top-level">Flow (Top Level)</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Trusted IT that clinicians rely on</li>
        <li>Seamless patient care workflows</li>
        <li>Digital initiatives delivered smoothly</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="effective-ownership">Effective Ownership</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Defined SLOs for critical systems</li>
        <li>Clear service ownership across teams</li>
        <li>Lifecycle planning for legacy systems</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="managed-work">Managed Work</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Regular patch cycles for all systems</li>
        <li>Tested incident response playbooks</li>
        <li>Repeatable clinician onboarding</li>
        <li>HL7/FHIR interface monitoring</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="basic-needs-foundation">Basic Needs (Foundation)</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>EMR uptime and reliability</li>
        <li>Core compute and storage capacity</li>
        <li>Network stability and performance</li>
        <li>On-call coverage and staffing</li>
        <li>Regulatory compliance backlog</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p><strong>The insight</strong>: if your basic needs (uptime,
        compute, people) aren’t met, chasing “flow” is a
        distraction.</p>
        <h2 id="why-only-one-thing-matters">Why Only One Thing
        Matters</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Theory of Constraints (TOC)</strong> explains
        why. In any complex system, one constraint throttles throughput
        more than any other. Fix that, and the entire system
        improves.</p>
        <p>Goldratt’s Five Focusing Steps provide the playbook:</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="assets/toc-5fs.png"
        alt="Theory of Constraints: 5 Focusing Steps" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Theory of Constraints: 5 Focusing
        Steps</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="toc-steps">
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p><strong>Identify the constraint</strong> — maybe it’s
        your patch cycle, maybe it’s Citrix capacity, maybe it’s HL7
        interface fragility.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Exploit it</strong> — squeeze what you can out of
        current tools and staff.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Subordinate everything else</strong> — stop
        chasing side projects until the bottleneck is relieved.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Elevate the constraint</strong> — make targeted
        investment.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Repeat</strong> — because once one constraint is
        solved, another emerges.</p></li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Healthcare CIOs already feel this intuitively. Whether it’s
        EMR downtime, slow imaging turnaround, or delayed clinician
        onboarding, the system only flows as fast as its narrowest
        point.</p>
        <h2 id="where-claude-code-changes-the-game">Where Claude Code
        Changes the Game</h2>
        <p>Historically, applying HoEN + TOC meant workshops with sticky
        notes, spreadsheets, and months of “maturity assessments.”
        Useful, but slow.</p>
        <p>Now, there’s <strong>Claude Code (CC)</strong>.</p>
        <p>Think of CC as your automation analyst:</p>
        <div class="claude-code-process">
        <p><strong>Inputs</strong>: EMR downtime logs, patch compliance
        reports (WSUS/SCCM), vulnerability scans, Citrix session counts,
        clinician onboarding ticket times.</p>
        <p><strong>Process</strong>: CC applies HoEN + TOC logic to
        identify the current bottleneck.</p>
        <p><strong>Outputs</strong>: A Primary Constraint Report with
        one bottleneck, why it matters, and what to do next — written
        for both executives and IT staff.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study">
        <p><strong>Mini-story</strong>: A CIO assumed the top issue was
        “lack of dashboards.” But CC, analyzing patch cadence and
        vulnerability scan data, identified <strong>patching
        lag</strong> as the true constraint: Windows servers and Citrix
        VDI hosts were 60+ days behind. The CIO shifted focus. Result:
        reduced ransomware exposure and restored clinician trust, all
        before investing in more dashboards.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="a-monthly-cadence-that-works">A Monthly Cadence That
        Works</h2>
        <p>Here’s what it looks like in practice:</p>
        <div class="monthly-process">
        <h3 id="collect-signals">1. Collect Signals</h3>
        <p>EMR uptime % (Epic/Meditech logs), patch compliance reports,
        Citrix utilization metrics, onboarding ticket times from
        ServiceNow/Jira.</p>
        <h3 id="run-cc">2. Run CC</h3>
        <p>Feed this data into a YAML/JSON schema. Ask CC to rank
        constraints.</p>
        <h3 id="review-the-report">3. Review the Report</h3>
        <p>See one bottleneck explained in board-level language (“patch
        lag exposes patient safety risk”) plus IT-level specifics
        (WSUS/SCCM enforcement, VLAN isolation for legacy PACS).</p>
        <h3 id="act">4. Act</h3>
        <p>Launch one Epic or initiative. Put secondary initiatives on
        hold until the constraint moves.</p>
        <h3 id="repeat-monthly">5. Repeat Monthly</h3>
        <p>The bottleneck will shift — from uptime → patching →
        onboarding → interface resiliency.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The result? <strong>Alignment</strong>. Executives,
        clinicians, and IT see the same “#1 constraint” and the same
        rationale.</p>
        <h2 id="why-this-works-in-healthcare-it">Why This Works in
        Healthcare IT</h2>
        <p>Hospitals are among the most complex IT environments on
        earth. EHR vendors, PACS, LIS, AD/LDAP, Citrix, HL7/FHIR
        interfaces, cybersecurity overlays, state/federal reporting —
        all intertwined.</p>
        <p>Traditional improvement approaches scatter effort across
        dozens of initiatives.</p>
        <p><strong>HoEN + TOC + CC gives you discipline and
        focus:</strong></p>
        <div class="benefits-grid">
        <p><strong>Credibility</strong>: Decisions aren’t gut feel;
        they’re grounded in a model.</p>
        <p><strong>Clarity</strong>: Clinicians, IT, and the board all
        see the same priority constraint.</p>
        <p><strong>Speed</strong>: CC generates reports in minutes. No
        six-month consulting cycle.</p>
        <p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Solve one constraint at a time →
        IT stability grows steadily.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="example-primary-constraint-report">Example Primary
        Constraint Report</h2>
        <div class="constraint-report">
        <p><strong>(As generated by CC, based on sample hospital IT
        data.)</strong></p>
        <h3
        id="primary-constraint-patch-cycle-lag-managed-work-cybersecurity">Primary
        Constraint: Patch Cycle Lag (Managed Work → Cybersecurity)</h3>
        <p><strong>Why Now:</strong> - 70% of Windows Server 2019
        instances are &gt;60 days behind - Citrix VDI hosts are two
        patch cycles late, leading to repeated CVEs in scans - PACS
        viewers are running outdated DICOM libraries - This creates a
        high-likelihood ransomware vector with direct patient safety
        risk</p>
        <p><strong>Proposed Countermeasure:</strong> - Automate patch
        rollout via WSUS + SCCM with 30-day SLA - Isolate legacy PACS
        viewers on segmented VLAN until patched - Establish monthly
        “Patch Tuesday” comms cadence with clinical units to avoid
        scheduling surprises</p>
        <p><strong>Acceptance Signals:</strong> - 95% of servers patched
        within 30 days - Vulnerability scans show zero repeat CVEs
        &gt;60 days old - PACS/radiology validated against vendor
        baselines by quarter end</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> - Cuts ransomware exposure
        significantly - Frees IT from manual patch firefighting - Boosts
        clinician trust that EMR and imaging won’t suddenly fail
        mid-shift</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="why-work-with-me">Why Work With Me</h2>
        <p>I’ve spent 30 years in embedded medical software, where
        failure isn’t an option. I know regulated environments,
        real-time constraints, and what it means when patient safety
        depends on code.</p>
        <p>I’ve also worked as an executive and process improver,
        helping leaders simplify complexity into actionable steps.</p>
        <p>And I use Claude Code every day — not just for development,
        but to automate prioritization, reporting, and decision
        discipline.</p>
        <p><strong>My offer</strong>: I’ll set up the system for you
        —</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The Hierarchy of Engineering Needs tailored for hospital
        IT</li>
        <li>A TOC-based cadence (monthly or quarterly) that keeps you
        focused</li>
        <li>Claude Code automation that turns raw IT metrics into
        CIO-ready reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you’re a hospital CIO, this means: <strong>no more
        “initiative whiplash.”</strong> Every month, you’ll know exactly
        what matters most.</p>
        <h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
        <p>Hospitals can’t afford IT drift. With HoEN, TOC, and Claude
        Code, you can cut through the noise, align stakeholders, and
        deliver IT clinicians trust.</p>
        <p><strong>👉 Contact me to see what this system would look like
        for your hospital.</strong></p>
