# Revenue Improvement Solutions

Boost your business's profitability through the science of constraints management and targeted optimization.

[Get Started](#contact) [Case Studies](#case-studies)

## Our Approach to Revenue Improvement

We use constraints management principles to identify and eliminate bottlenecks that limit your business's earning potential.

### Constraints Management
We identify the key constraints in your business operations that are limiting overall performance and develop strategies to maximize throughput.

### Process Optimization
Streamline your core business processes to eliminate waste, improve flow, and increase capacity without additional resources.

### Profit Maximization
Implement targeted strategies to improve pricing, reduce operational costs, and optimize resource allocation for maximum profitability.

## The Theory of Constraints

Our revenue improvement methodology is based on the proven Theory of Constraints (TOC) framework.

1. **Identify**  
   We pinpoint the specific constraints that are limiting your business's overall throughput and revenue potential.

2. **Exploit**  
   We develop strategies to get the maximum performance from your existing constraints without major investment.

3. **Subordinate**  
   We align all other processes to support the constraint, ensuring the entire system works in harmony.

4. **Elevate**  
   Once exploited fully, we implement targeted investments to break the constraint and move to the next limiting factor.

## Success Stories

See how our revenue improvement solutions have transformed businesses across various industries.

> By identifying our key constraints in the production process, Common Sense helped increase our throughput by 35% without additional equipment, resulting in a 28% profit increase within 3 months.  
> **Operations Director, Custom Furniture Manufacturer**

> The constraints-based pricing strategy Common Sense implemented for our service business increased our average project value by 42% while actually improving our close rate.  
> **Owner, Professional Services Firm**

> By restructuring our fulfillment process based on constraints management principles, we reduced delivery times by 65% and increased order volume by 40% with the same staff.  
> **CEO, Specialty Consumer Products**

# SMS Consent & Privacy

How we obtain consent for SMS communications, what we send, and how to opt out.

## How We Obtain SMS Consent

We only send text messages to clients and prospects who have clearly agreed to receive them. Our primary consent methods are:

### Verbal Consent

During a phone call with one of our voice agents, we use the following script:

> “Hi [Name], this is [Agent] from Common Sense Systems, Inc. We’d like to offer you the option of receiving text messages about your services, such as scheduling, reminders, and important updates, from our toll-free number +1 (833) 570-5023. Message and data rates may apply, and frequency varies. Text messages are entirely optional — you can still receive all updates and information by phone or email if you prefer. Would you like to also receive certain updates and reminders by text message from +1 (833) 570-5023? You can reply STOP anytime to opt out and HELP for support.”

If you agree, our agent records your consent in our **Postgres DB**, including phone number, name (if provided), date/time, agent name/initials, call recording ID (when available), and consent source (Verbal or Keyword). A confirmation SMS is sent immediately.

### SMS Messages Are Entirely Optional

*Important:* SMS messages are entirely optional. You will continue to receive services and support even if you do not consent to text messaging.

### Keyword Opt-In

You may also opt in by texting an explicit keyword (e.g., **YES**) to our toll-free number **+1 (833) 570-5023**.

*We do not send marketing or promotional texts without explicit prior agreement.*

## Types of Messages You May Receive

- Appointment confirmations and reminders
- Service updates and notifications
- Contact information or follow-up details from a call
- Responses to your inquiries

## How to Revoke Your Consent

### Text STOP (Fastest)

Reply **STOP** to any message from **+1 (833) 570-5023**. You will **immediately** receive a confirmation that you’ve been unsubscribed. For assistance, reply **HELP** to receive our support contact details. To resume messages after opting out, reply **UNSTOP**.

### Contact Us

- **Call us (voice only):** (425) 979-2282
- **Email:** [info@common-sense.com](mailto:info@common-sense.com)
- [Contact form](/contact)

## Important Information

**Message Frequency.** Typically 1–4 messages per month, unless you request additional updates.

**Message and Data Rates.** Standard carrier message and data rates may apply. We do not charge for SMS messages.

**Supported Carriers.** We work with all major U.S. carriers. Delivery and timing may vary by provider.

**Privacy.** Your phone number and SMS preferences are protected under our [privacy practices](/privacy.html). We do not share your information with third parties without your consent.

Handle routine inquiries, provide product information, troubleshoot issues, and escalate complex cases to human agents when needed.

#### Sales Support
Qualify leads, provide product demonstrations, answer pricing questions, and guide prospects through the sales process.

#### Internal Operations
Assist employees with HR policies, IT support, training resources, and internal procedures.

#### Public Engagement

Improvement Suggestions  
1. Add quantitative evidence: include a mini-case study with actual before/after metrics (appeal turnaround time, denial-reversal rate, staff-turnover reduction %) to move the argument from anecdotal to data-driven.  
2. Address risks & ethics: dedicate a short section to potential pitfalls—AI hallucinations, bias in training data, patient consent for AI interaction, and how the hospital maintains oversight—so the piece feels balanced and trustworthy.  
3. Clarify deployment roadmap: provide a high-level timeline (week 1-2 integration, week 3 pilot, week 4-6 refinement) and typical budget range so interested administrators can judge feasibility next to the emotional appeal.

3. Real-World Scenarios – voice commands for rescheduling, ticket updates, priority triage.  
4. Upgrade Path – add features, integrations, capacity as the business grows.  
5. Competitive Urgency – early-adopter advantage; operating without an AI agent soon = competitive disadvantage.  
Core concepts: Predictable SaaS budgeting, immediate ROI, scalable AI automation, competitive necessity in 2025.  
Keywords: Voice agents, business automation, AI assistant, cost analysis, productivity, monthly plan.  
Author / Publisher: Common Sense Systems, Inc. (Kirkland, WA).  
Geo relevance: United States; phone/email contact in WA state.

Improvement Suggestions

--- Blog summary synthesized from ./www/blog/2025/09/explaining-spikingbrain-brain-inspired-large-models-for-long-context-efficiency/index.html ---
Summary  
Main topic: SpikingBrain – a family of brain-inspired LLMs that trade quadratic self-attention for linear/hybrid attention plus a spiking-activation scheme to slash compute and energy on very long contexts (128 k–4 M tokens).

Key ideas & sections  
- Architecture: 7 B pure-linear-attention model; 76 B MoE (12 B active) hybrid model; intra-layer mixing; activations converted to sparse integer “spikes” for add-only math.  
- Training: “conversion” of existing Transformer weights instead of from-scratch pre-training (~2 % compute); 150–160 B tokens continual pre-train + SFT; stable multi-GPU runs on non-NVIDIA MetaX C550.  
- Quality: competitive but not SOTA—MMLU ~65–74 across variants; Chinese benchmarks (CMMLU/CEval) included.  
- Efficiency claims: 26× faster TTFT at 1 M tokens, >100× at 4 M; ~69 % activation sparsity; 15× CPU decode speed-up for 1 B compressed model; large MAC-energy savings vs FP16.  
- Limitations: baselines partly mismatched; >2 M-token numbers extrapolated; quality still slightly behind best fully-trained models.

Author & date: John Sambrook, 27 Sept 2025.

Keywords/themes: linear attention, spiking neural networks, long-context efficiency, conversion-based training, non-NVIDIA hardware, energy-efficient inference.

Improvement Suggestions  
1. Add head-to-head comparisons with leading linear-attention models (e.g., Mamba, Performer) on identical data and hardware to validate quality/efficiency trade-offs.  
2. Release open-source code, checkpoints and reproducible benchmarks so third parties can verify extreme-sequence claims and measure real-world energy use.  
3. Expand evaluation beyond Chinese-centric tasks—include standard long-context benchmarks (e.g., L-Eval, ZeroSCROLLS) and English-only baselines for balanced assessment.


--- Blog summary synthesized from ./www/blog/2025/10/is-non-value-added-work-really-neutral-rethinking-value-in-lean/index.html ---
Summary  
Main topic: Lean’s “value-added vs. non-value-added” dichotomy is too blunt; some “non-value” tasks are essential enabling conditions, not waste.  
Key message: No work is neutral—every activity either creates customer-perceived value, enables that value (compliance, safety, regulatory), or subtracts value as pure waste.  

Major sections  
1. Beyond Value-Added vs. Non-Value-Added  
2. The Hidden Middle: Enabling Conditions  
3. Reconciling Purist Lean with Pragmatic Reality (comparison table)  
4. Why This Matters (focus improvement on waste, not on necessary enablers)  
5. Closing Thought  

Key concepts  
Customer-defined value, enabling conditions, necessary non-value-added, waste elimination, regulated industries (healthcare, aerospace, med-device).  

Keywords/themes  
Lean, value stream, compliance, regulatory submission, safety checks, TOC, process improvement, waste vs. enabler.  

Geographical relevance  
None explicitly; author firm located in Kirkland, WA, USA.  

Author  
Common Sense Systems, Inc. (no individual author named).  

Improvement Suggestions  
1. Add real-world case: show before/after metrics from a med-device firm that separated enabling conditions from waste.  
2. Include a decision tree or checklist readers can use to classify their own activities.  
3. Expand on how Theory of Constraints complements this view—explain which enabling conditions might actually be system constraints.
