# Revenue Improvement Solutions

Boost your business's profitability through the science of constraints management and targeted optimization.

[Get Started](#contact) [Case Studies](#case-studies)

## Our Approach to Revenue Improvement

We use constraints management principles to identify and eliminate bottlenecks that limit your business's earning potential.

### Constraints Management
We identify the key constraints in your business operations that are limiting overall performance and develop strategies to maximize throughput.

### Process Optimization
Streamline your core business processes to eliminate waste, improve flow, and increase capacity without additional resources.

### Profit Maximization
Implement targeted strategies to improve pricing, reduce operational costs, and optimize resource allocation for maximum profitability.

## The Theory of Constraints

Our revenue improvement methodology is based on the proven Theory of Constraints (TOC) framework.

1. **Identify**  
   We pinpoint the specific constraints that are limiting your business's overall throughput and revenue potential.

2. **Exploit**  
   We develop strategies to get the maximum performance from your existing constraints without major investment.

3. **Subordinate**  
   We align all other processes to support the constraint, ensuring the entire system works in harmony.

4. **Elevate**  
   Once exploited fully, we implement targeted investments to break the constraint and move to the next limiting factor.

## Success Stories

See how our revenue improvement solutions have transformed businesses across various industries.

> By identifying our key constraints in the production process, Common Sense helped increase our throughput by 35% without additional equipment, resulting in a 28% profit increase within 3 months.  
> **Operations Director, Custom Furniture Manufacturer**

> The constraints-based pricing strategy Common Sense implemented for our service business increased our average project value by 42% while actually improving our close rate.  
> **Owner, Professional Services Firm**

> By restructuring our fulfillment process based on constraints management principles, we reduced delivery times by 65% and increased order volume by 40% with the same staff.  
> **CEO, Specialty Consumer Products**

# SMS Consent & Privacy

How we obtain consent for SMS communications, what we send, and how to opt out.

## How We Obtain SMS Consent

We only send text messages to clients and prospects who have clearly agreed to receive them. Our primary consent methods are:

### Verbal Consent

During a phone call with one of our voice agents, we use the following script:

> “Hi [Name], this is [Agent] from Common Sense Systems, Inc. We’d like to offer you the option of receiving text messages about your services, such as scheduling, reminders, and important updates, from our toll-free number +1 (833) 570-5023. Message and data rates may apply, and frequency varies. Text messages are entirely optional — you can still receive all updates and information by phone or email if you prefer. Would you like to also receive certain updates and reminders by text message from +1 (833) 570-5023? You can reply STOP anytime to opt out and HELP for support.”

If you agree, our agent records your consent in our **Postgres DB**, including phone number, name (if provided), date/time, agent name/initials, call recording ID (when available), and consent source (Verbal or Keyword). A confirmation SMS is sent immediately.

### SMS Messages Are Entirely Optional

*Important:* SMS messages are entirely optional. You will continue to receive services and support even if you do not consent to text messaging.

### Keyword Opt-In

You may also opt in by texting an explicit keyword (e.g. **YES**) to our toll-free number **+1 (833) 570-5023**.

*We do not send marketing or promotional texts without explicit prior agreement.*

## Types of Messages You May Receive

- Appointment confirmations and reminders
- Service updates and notifications
- Contact information or follow-up details from a call
- Responses to your inquiries

## How to Revoke Your Consent

### Text STOP (Fastest)

Reply **STOP** to any message from **+1 (833) 570-5023**. You will **immediately** receive a confirmation that you’ve been unsubscribed. For assistance, reply **HELP** to receive our support contact details. To resume messages after opting out, reply **UNSTOP**.

### Contact Us

- **Call us (voice only):** (425) 979-2282
- **Email:** [info@common-sense.com](mailto:info@common-sense.com)
- [Contact form](/contact)

## Important Information

**Message Frequency.** Typically 1–4 messages per month, unless you request additional updates.

**Message and Data Rates.** Standard carrier message and data rates may apply. We do not charge for SMS messages.

**Supported Carriers.** We work with all major U.S. carriers. Delivery and timing may vary by provider.

**Privacy.** Your phone number and SMS preferences are protected under our [privacy practices](/privacy.html). We do not share your information with third parties without your consent.

--- Blog summary synthesized from ./www/blog/2025/09/explaining-spikingbrain-brain-inspired-large-models-for-long-context-efficiency/index.html ---
Summary  
Main topic: SpikingBrain – a family of brain-inspired LLMs that trade quadratic self-attention for linear/hybrid attention plus a spiking-activation scheme to slash compute and energy on very long sequences (128 k–4 M tokens).

Key ideas & sections  
- Architecture: 7 B pure-linear-attention model; 76 B MoE (12 B active) hybrid model; both use low-rank “conversion” of existing Transformer weights and adaptive-threshold spiking that produces ~69 % activation sparsity and addition-heavy math.  
- Training: continual pre-train 150–160 B tokens on MetaX C550 non-NVIDIA GPUs, then SFT chat tuning; 128 k context during training.  
- Quality: recovers most base-model scores (MMLU ~65–74) at <2 % of from-scratch compute.  
- Efficiency: 26× faster TTFT at 1 M tokens, >100× at 4 M; near-constant ~1 s TTFT when GPU count scales; 5× training throughput gain; up to 15× CPU/mobile decode speedup for 1 B compressed variant; large MAC-energy savings.  
- Caveats: baselines partly disadvantaged on Chinese benchmarks; >2 M-token baselines extrapolated; quality still slightly below best fully-trained peers.  
- Context: part of broader linear-attention / long-context movement; demonstrates viable large-scale LLM stack outside NVIDIA ecosystem.

Author & date: John Sambrook, 27 Sep 2025.

Improvement Suggestions  
1. Add head-to-head plots against strongest open long-context baselines (e.g., YaRN, LongLoRA) on identical English-heavy tasks to remove data-set bias concerns.  
2. Release reproducibility bundle: converted checkpoints, spiking-operator code, and MetaX-C550 benchmarking scripts so external groups can verify speed/sparsity claims.  
3. Provide ablation quantifying how much of the gain comes from linear attention versus spiking activations versus MoE sparsity, clarifying which component is the prime driver.


--- Blog summary synthesized from ./www/blog/2025/10/is-non-value-added-work-really-neutral-rethinking-value-in-lean/index.html ---
Summary  
Main topic: Lean’s “value-added / non-value-added” dichotomy is too blunt; some “non-value” tasks are actually essential enabling conditions that must be streamlined—not eliminated—especially in regulated industries.  

Key sections  
1. Beyond Value-Added vs. Non-Value-Added – explains why “neutral” work is a myth; every task either creates value, enables it, or subtracts it.  
2. The Hidden Middle: Enabling Conditions – uses medical-device compliance to show activities customers won’t pay for but that gate market access.  
3. Reconciling Purist Lean with Pragmatic Reality – table contrasts LEI lexicon with a TOC-infused view that splits non-value work into “enabling” and “waste.”  
4. Why This Matters – clarifies improvement priorities: simplify enabling conditions, eliminate true waste, maximize direct value.  
5. Closing Thought – urges leaders to discriminate among the three categories and focus energy accordingly.  

Key concepts & keywords  
Value-added, non-value-added, enabling conditions, waste, Lean, Theory of Constraints (TOC), regulatory compliance, healthcare, medical devices, process improvement.  

Geographical relevance  
None (generic business/process focus).  

Author  
Common Sense Systems, Inc. (Kirkland, WA).  

Improvement Suggestions  
1. Add real-world case data—e.g., before/after cycle-time or cost metrics from a hospital or device firm—to quantify the benefit of treating enabling conditions separately.  
2. Include a simple decision tree or checklist readers can use to classify their own tasks into “direct value,” “enabling,” or “waste.”  
3. Expand on how TOC tools (Current-Reality Tree, Conflict Cloud) can be combined with Lean to surface and resolve systemic conflicts around compliance requirements.
