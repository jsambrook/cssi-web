# Revenue Improvement Solutions

Boost your business's profitability through the science of constraints management and targeted optimization.

[Get Started](#contact) | [Case Studies](#case-studies)

## Our Approach to Revenue Improvement

We use constraints management principles to identify and eliminate bottlenecks that limit your business's earning potential.

### Constraints Management (CM)

We identify the key constraints in your business operations that are limiting overall performance and develop strategies to maximize throughput.

### Process Optimization (PO)

Streamline your core business processes to eliminate waste, improve flow, and increase capacity without additional resources.

### Profit Maximization (PM)

Implement targeted strategies to improve pricing, reduce operational costs, and optimize resource allocation for maximum profitability.

## The Theory of Constraints

Our revenue improvement methodology is based on the proven Theory of Constraints (TOC) framework.

1. **Identify**
   We pinpoint the specific constraints that are limiting your business's overall throughput and revenue potential.

2. **Exploit**
   We develop strategies to get the maximum performance from your existing constraints without major investment.

3. **Subordinate**
   We align all other processes to support the constraint, ensuring the entire system works in harmony.

4. **Elevate**
   Once exploited fully, we implement targeted investments to break the constraint and move to the next limiting factor.

## Success Stories {#case-studies}

See how our revenue improvement solutions have transformed businesses across various industries.

> By identifying our key constraints in the production process, Common Sense helped increase our throughput by 35% without additional equipment, resulting in a 28% profit increase within 3 months.
>
> **Manufacturing Company**  
> Operations Director, Custom Furniture Manufacturer

> The constraints-based pricing strategy Common Sense implemented for our service business increased our average project value by 42% while actually improving our close rate.
