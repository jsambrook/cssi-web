# Blog Article Brand Alignment Review

Reviewed 2026-02-16 against `BRAND-GUIDELINES.md`. 24 published posts scored; 4 unpublished stubs noted separately.

## Evaluation Criteria

Each post was evaluated on:

- **Opening** -- Does it ground the reader in something concrete (scene, observation, specific fact)?
- **Voice** -- Does it sound like John, writing in first person from real experience?
- **AI writing tells** -- Presence of banned vocabulary, formulaic structures, relentless positivity, hedging both sides
- **TOC terms** -- If used, are they introduced with context for newcomers?
- **Ending** -- Open-hand invitation, or hard-sell CTA?
- **Length vs. substance** -- Is the length earned?
- **Headline** -- Specific and concrete, or clickbait/vague?

## Rankings: Most to Least On-Brand

### Tier 1: Reference Quality (9-10)

| Rank | Score | Post                                          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | 10    | The Cath Lab Is Empty at 2 AM                 | The reference post. The brand guidelines quote it three times. Specific scene opening, unmistakably John's voice, footnoted evidence, open-hand ending, no AI tells.                                   |
| 2    | 9     | Doing My Taxes with Claude Code and Codex     | Concrete personal opening (cited in the guidelines), real tools named, honest and specific throughout. Minor: "What This Means for Knowledge Work" section edges toward generalized commentary.        |
| 3    | 9     | Why Agile Fails in Hardware                   | Excellent scene from direct experience ("I have sat in countless engineering reviews..."). First-person, opinionated, TOC terms well-introduced, no AI tells. Minor: closing uses "we" instead of "I." |
| 4    | 9     | Stop Hiring Your Way Out of a Process Problem | Headline is literally cited as a good example in the brand guidelines. Board-meeting scene opening, punchy math, zero padding. Minor: no contact invitation at the end.                                |

### Tier 2: Strong (7-8)

| Rank | Score | Post                                          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5    | 8     | Cancel Your SaaS, Keep Your Data              | Real example (ProtonMail cancellation), honest about limitations, good open-hand ending. Minor: "A Broader Observation" section slightly generic.                                                                                 |
| 6    | 8     | The Post-Acute Care Plan (PACP)               | Deep, well-sourced concept paper -- the guidelines specifically name it as a piece that earns its length. 11 footnotes, original analysis. Minor: no first-person voice, no engagement invitation.                                |
| 7    | 8     | The Biggest Satisficing Trap AI Breaks        | Best voice match in its batch -- "I'm 66. I've been writing software for over thirty years." Perfect open-hand ending. Deductions: clickbait headline ("Isn't What You Think"), "satisficing" in title but never defined in body. |
| 8    | 8     | The 'Quality' Illusion (MedTech)              | First-person anecdote, specific (firmware bug, three lines of code), no AI tells, perfect length (~400 words). Minor: TOC term "elevate the constraint" not glossed, no open-hand ending.                                         |
| 9    | 8     | The Three-Way Email Paradox                   | Concrete scenario opening (Jim in Bellevue), local specificity, conversational voice, good math. Minor: "book a free consultation" is slightly sales-forward for brand guidelines.                                                |
| 10   | 7     | The 'Perfect' Product That Killed the Company | Good storytelling, cross-domain bridge from MedTech to healthcare. Deductions: no open-hand ending (closed-fist declarative), parallel bullet lists, motivational final paragraph.                                                |

### Tier 3: Mixed (5-6)

| Rank | Score | Post                                    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---- | ----- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 11   | 6     | AI-Facilitated Constraint Resolution    | Excellent opening (boardroom scene), substantive five-phase walkthrough with SVG diagrams. Deductions: no first-person voice at all, academic headline.                                                      |
| 12   | 6     | Hidden Conflicts in Healthcare          | Strong substantive analysis using a real hospital policy, good TOC/EC introduction. Deductions: abstract opening, heavy formatting, padded ending sections, vague headline, "navigate" appears.              |
| 13   | 5     | Decision-Ready Beats Presentation-Ready | Clean writing, strong headline, appropriate length. Deductions: no first-person voice, no open-hand ending. Reads like a LinkedIn post.                                                                      |
| 14   | 5     | Short Cycles, Real Outcomes             | Efficient writing, practical idea. Deductions: no first-person voice, no open-hand ending, generic headline. Could have been written by anyone.                                                              |
| 15   | 5     | Why Healthcare Is So Stuck              | Strong analytical substance, good TOC term introductions (CRT, UDEs), references. Deductions: uses "In today's U.S. healthcare landscape" (explicitly banned phrase), abstract opening, mostly third-person. |

### Tier 4: Needs Revision (3-4)

| Rank | Score | Post                           | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 17   | 4     | Stop Blaming People            | Real structural conflicts identified. Deductions: no first-person voice, formulaic template repeated twice, "Here's the good news:" construction, newsletter subscribe CTA ending, excessive bold formatting.                                                       |
| 18   | 4     | Architecting Hospital Care     | Interesting impostor-syndrome angle, first person present. Deductions: uses "deep dive" (banned, literally the first line), "let's explore" (banned), effusive/motivational tone, marketing CTA ending, vague headline.                                             |
| 19   | 4     | Align Teams on Minimum Dataset | Clear idea. Deductions: no first person, no open-hand ending, TOC jargon ("Subordinate the Data") without context, feels like a quick framework dump. ~350 words with no personal grounding.                                                                        |

Deductions: uses "Let's examine" (banned), "streamlined" (banned), no first-person voice, abstract opening, formulaic five-point parallel structure, heavy contact-card ending. Reads like a consulting template.                             |

Uses "revolutionary" (banned), no first-person voice, fictional characters presented as real, hard-sell CTA with phone number, "Discover how..." opening, relentless positivity, tricolon marketing prose.

## Recurring Patterns

### What the top-tier posts share

1. Open with a concrete scene or specific personal fact
2. First-person voice throughout -- unmistakably John
3. No banned AI vocabulary
4. Open-hand ending (invitation to engage, not a pitch)
5. Length matched to substance -- no padding

### What the bottom-tier posts share

1. Third-person or corporate "we" voice -- John is absent
2. Banned words and phrases appear
3. Formulaic parallel structures and excessive formatting
4. Hard-sell CTAs, consultation pitches, or newsletter subscribe endings
5. Abstract or generic openings instead of grounded scenes

### Highest-impact improvements

1. **Restore John's first-person voice.** The single biggest predictor of brand alignment. Every post that drops the "I" drifts toward marketing-copy tone. Posts scoring 4 or below almost universally lack first-person voice.

2. **Remove banned vocabulary.** Twelve instances across eight posts. These are quick fixes with outsized impact on perceived authenticity.

3. **Replace hard-sell endings with open-hand invitations.** Several posts end with "book a consultation" or newsletter CTAs. Replacing these with "I'd welcome the conversation" plus a contact link would bring them in line.

4. **Ground abstract openings in specific scenes.** Posts that open with "In today's healthcare landscape..." or thesis statements can be rewritten to start with a concrete moment from experience, then earn the abstraction.

5. **Complete the four stub posts** with body content and the required `metaTitle`/`metaDescription` frontmatter fields.
