            </div>

            <div class="voice-agent-container">
                <h3>Campaign Applications Overview</h3>
                <p>Voice agents are transforming how candidates, advocacy groups, and community organizations connect with their audiences. Unlike traditional campaign materials, voice agents provide interactive, personalized experiences that can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Answer Policy Questions:</strong> Provide detailed information about positions, voting records, and policy proposals</li>
                    <li><strong>Share Candidate Background:</strong> Communicate experience, qualifications, and personal story in an engaging format</li>
                    <li><strong>Explain Complex Issues:</strong> Break down complicated policy matters into understandable conversations</li>
                    <li><strong>Engage Diverse Audiences:</strong> Reach voters who prefer voice interaction over reading campaign literature</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide 24/7 Availability:</strong> Offer information and engagement outside of traditional campaign hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Personalize Interactions:</strong> Adapt responses based on voter interests and concerns</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These capabilities make voice agents particularly valuable for reaching busy voters, older populations who prefer phone-based communication, and communities where voice interaction is more culturally appropriate than text-based interfaces.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Community Groups -->
            <div class="voice-agent-container">

Voice agents help these groups extend their reach beyond traditional meetings and newsletters, providing 24/7 access to their mission, values, and calls to action.</p>

                <p>Community groups benefit from voice agents by creating more inclusive engagement opportunities that reach busy residents, older community members who prefer phone-based interaction, and populations who may face barriers with traditional digital communication methods. This technology allows grassroots organizations to amplify their impact while maintaining the personal, conversational tone that builds community trust.</p>
