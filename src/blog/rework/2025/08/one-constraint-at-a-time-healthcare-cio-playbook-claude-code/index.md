title: "One Constraint at a Time: A CIO's Playbook for Hospital IT with Claude Code"
---

## Monday Morning, 8:03 a.m.

The EMR freezes during morning rounds. Clinicians are locked out. Patients wait. Your phone lights up with texts from the Chief Medical Officer: "What's happening? How long?"

In the IT command channel, the theories fly:

- "SQL Server is thrashing tempdb again ‚Äî deadlocks are spiking."
- "SAN latency went red ‚Äî storage headroom is gone."
- "Active Directory token refresh failed; half the Citrix sessions are invalid."
- "We need to double the VDI hosts ‚Äî remote access is maxed."
- "If this were on Aurora or CosmosDB, we wouldn't be dealing with this."

A vendor chimes in: "Buy our AIOps platform ‚Äî it would have predicted this outage."

They're all technically valid. But as CIO, you ask yourself: **Which one matters most right now?**

That's the daily reality: dozens of smart people, dozens of smart fixes ‚Äî but limited time, budget, and energy.

What if you had a way to cut through the noise and consistently identify the single constraint that, if fixed, moves the whole system forward?

## The Model That Cuts Through the Noise

Engineering leaders call it the **Hierarchy of Engineering Needs (HoEN)**. Think of it as Maslow's hierarchy for IT. Before you dream of "flow," you must shore up the basics.

Here's how it maps to a hospital IT department:

![Hierarchy of Engineering Needs for Hospital IT](assets/hierarchy-pyramid.png)

<div class="hierarchy-breakdown">

### Flow (Top Level)
- Trusted IT that clinicians rely on
- Seamless patient care workflows
- Digital initiatives delivered smoothly

### Effective Ownership
- Defined SLOs for critical systems
- Clear service ownership across teams
- Lifecycle planning for legacy systems

### Managed Work
- Regular patch cycles for all systems
- Tested incident response playbooks
- Repeatable clinician onboarding
- HL7/FHIR interface monitoring

### Basic Needs (Foundation)
- EMR uptime and reliability
- Core compute and storage capacity
- Network stability and performance
- On-call coverage and staffing
- Regulatory compliance backlog

</div>

**The insight**: if your basic needs (uptime, compute, people) aren't met, chasing "flow" is a distraction.

## Why Only One Thing Matters

The **Theory of Constraints (TOC)** explains why. In any complex system, one constraint throttles throughput more than any other. Fix that, and the entire system improves.

Goldratt's Five Focusing Steps provide the playbook:

![Theory of Constraints: 5 Focusing Steps](assets/toc-5fs.png)

<div class="toc-steps">

1. **Identify the constraint** ‚Äî maybe it's your patch cycle, maybe it's Citrix capacity, maybe it's HL7 interface fragility.

2. **Exploit it** ‚Äî squeeze what you can out of current tools and staff.

3. **Subordinate everything else** ‚Äî stop chasing side projects until the bottleneck is relieved.

4. **Elevate the constraint** ‚Äî make targeted investment.

5. **Repeat** ‚Äî because once one constraint is solved, another emerges.

</div>

Healthcare CIOs already feel this intuitively. Whether it's EMR downtime, slow imaging turnaround, or delayed clinician onboarding, the system only flows as fast as its narrowest point.

## Where Claude Code Changes the Game

Historically, applying HoEN + TOC meant workshops with sticky notes, spreadsheets, and months of "maturity assessments." Useful, but slow.

Now, there's **Claude Code (CC)**.

Think of CC as your automation analyst:

<div class="claude-code-process">

**Inputs**: EMR downtime logs, patch compliance reports (WSUS/SCCM), vulnerability scans, Citrix session counts, clinician onboarding ticket times.

**Process**: CC applies HoEN + TOC logic to identify the current bottleneck.

**Outputs**: A Primary Constraint Report with one bottleneck, why it matters, and what to do next ‚Äî written for both executives and IT staff.

</div>

<div class="case-study">

**Mini-story**: A CIO assumed the top issue was "lack of dashboards." But CC, analyzing patch cadence and vulnerability scan data, identified **patching lag** as the true constraint: Windows servers and Citrix VDI hosts were 60+ days behind. The CIO shifted focus. Result: reduced ransomware exposure and restored clinician trust, all before investing in more dashboards.

</div>

## A Monthly Cadence That Works

Here's what it looks like in practice:

<div class="monthly-process">

### 1. Collect Signals
EMR uptime % (Epic/Meditech logs), patch compliance reports, Citrix utilization metrics, onboarding ticket times from ServiceNow/Jira.

### 2. Run CC
Feed this data into a YAML/JSON schema. Ask CC to rank constraints.

### 3. Review the Report
See one bottleneck explained in board-level language ("patch lag exposes patient safety risk") plus IT-level specifics (WSUS/SCCM enforcement, VLAN isolation for legacy PACS).

### 4. Act
Launch one Epic or initiative. Put secondary initiatives on hold until the constraint moves.

### 5. Repeat Monthly
The bottleneck will shift ‚Äî from uptime ‚Üí patching ‚Üí onboarding ‚Üí interface resiliency.

</div>

The result? **Alignment**. Executives, clinicians, and IT see the same "#1 constraint" and the same rationale.

## Why This Works in Healthcare IT

Hospitals are among the most complex IT environments on earth. EHR vendors, PACS, LIS, AD/LDAP, Citrix, HL7/FHIR interfaces, cybersecurity overlays, state/federal reporting ‚Äî all intertwined.

Traditional improvement approaches scatter effort across dozens of initiatives.

**HoEN + TOC + CC gives you discipline and focus:**

<div class="benefits-grid">

**Credibility**: Decisions aren't gut feel; they're grounded in a model.

**Clarity**: Clinicians, IT, and the board all see the same priority constraint.

**Speed**: CC generates reports in minutes. No six-month consulting cycle.

**Resilience**: Solve one constraint at a time ‚Üí IT stability grows steadily.

</div>

## Example Primary Constraint Report

<div class="constraint-report">

**(As generated by CC, based on sample hospital IT data.)**

### Primary Constraint: Patch Cycle Lag (Managed Work ‚Üí Cybersecurity)

**Why Now:**
- 70% of Windows Server 2019 instances are >60 days behind
- Citrix VDI hosts are two patch cycles late, leading to repeated CVEs in scans
- PACS viewers are running outdated DICOM libraries
- This creates a high-likelihood ransomware vector with direct patient safety risk

**Proposed Countermeasure:**
- Automate patch rollout via WSUS + SCCM with 30-day SLA
- Isolate legacy PACS viewers on segmented VLAN until patched
- Establish monthly "Patch Tuesday" comms cadence with clinical units to avoid scheduling surprises

**Acceptance Signals:**
- 95% of servers patched within 30 days
- Vulnerability scans show zero repeat CVEs >60 days old
- PACS/radiology validated against vendor baselines by quarter end

**Impact:**
- Cuts ransomware exposure significantly
- Frees IT from manual patch firefighting
- Boosts clinician trust that EMR and imaging won't suddenly fail mid-shift

## Why Work With Me

I've spent 30 years in embedded medical software, where failure isn't an option. I know regulated environments, real-time constraints, and what it means when patient safety depends on code.

I've also worked as an executive and process improver, helping leaders simplify complexity into actionable steps.

And I use Claude Code every day ‚Äî not just for development, but to automate prioritization, reporting, and decision discipline.

**My offer**: I'll set up the system for you ‚Äî

- The Hierarchy of Engineering Needs tailored for hospital IT
- A TOC-based cadence (monthly or quarterly) that keeps you focused
- Claude Code automation that turns raw IT metrics into CIO-ready reports

If you're a hospital CIO, this means: **no more "initiative whiplash."** Every month, you'll know exactly what matters most.

## Call to Action

Hospitals can't afford IT drift. With HoEN, TOC, and Claude Code, you can cut through the noise, align stakeholders, and deliver IT clinicians trust.
