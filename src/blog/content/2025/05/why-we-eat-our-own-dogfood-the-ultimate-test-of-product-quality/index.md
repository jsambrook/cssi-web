## Introduction: The Power of Practicing What We Preach

In the tech world, there's a peculiar phrase that gets tossed around in product development circles: "eating your own dogfood." While it might sound unappetizing at first, this concept represents one of the most powerful quality assurance strategies a technology company can employ. At Common Sense Systems, we don't just talk about this practice—we live it every day.

Dogfooding, as it's commonly known, refers to the practice of using your own products internally before releasing them to customers. It's about being your own first and most demanding customer. This approach forces us to experience our software exactly as our clients do, revealing pain points, usability issues, and opportunities for improvement that might otherwise go unnoticed until after release.

But why is this practice so critical to our success and, more importantly, to the success of our clients? In this article, we'll explore how our commitment to using our own tools has shaped our development process, improved our products, and ultimately delivered better results for the businesses we serve.

## What Does "Eating Your Own Dogfood" Really Mean?

### The Origin of an Unusual Term

The term "eating your own dogfood" has an interesting history in the tech industry. It reportedly originated in the 1980s when a Microsoft executive wrote a memo titled "Eating Our Own Dogfood," encouraging employees to use the company's products internally. The metaphor stuck, and for good reason—if you wouldn't feed your dog something you wouldn't eat yourself, why would you expect customers to use products you wouldn't?

### Beyond Testing: A Philosophy of Product Development

At Common Sense Systems, dogfooding goes far beyond basic quality assurance testing. It represents a fundamental philosophy about how we approach product development:

1. **Authentic user experience**: We become real users, not just developers or testers
2. **Continuous feedback loop**: Daily use provides constant opportunities for improvement
3. **Skin in the game**: Our team feels personally invested in fixing issues quickly
4. **Cultural alignment**: Everyone understands that quality isn't just a department—it's a mindset

As our CEO often says, "We don't build software we wouldn't stake our own business on." This commitment means that every feature, interface, and workflow in our products has been battle-tested in real-world scenarios before it ever reaches our clients.

## The Tangible Benefits of Our Dogfooding Approach

### 1. Catching Issues Before They Reach Customers

When we use our own products daily, bugs and usability issues have nowhere to hide. In 2024 alone, our internal usage identified over 200 potential improvements before they could impact our customers. These ranged from minor interface inconsistencies to more significant workflow bottlenecks that might have caused frustration for users.

For example, when implementing our new project management module, our marketing team discovered that the notification system was sending too many alerts for minor updates. This feedback led to a complete redesign of our notification preferences, allowing for more granular control—a feature our customers now consistently rate as one of their favorites.

### 2. Building More Intuitive Products

There's a significant difference between what looks good in design mockups and what actually feels intuitive during daily use. By relying on our own tools to run our business, we've developed a heightened sensitivity to user experience issues.

Our customer support team uses our CRM solution to manage all client interactions, which led to a complete overhaul of our ticket categorization system. What seemed logical in theory proved cumbersome in practice, and the redesigned approach now saves our team—and our customers—an average of 12 minutes per support interaction.

### 3. Accelerating Development Cycles

When the people developing the product are also using it daily, the feedback loop tightens dramatically. Our development team doesn't have to wait for formal user testing or customer complaints to identify issues—they experience them firsthand and often fix them immediately.

> "The best QA team is a development team that depends on their own product to get their work done. Nothing motivates fixes faster than personal frustration." — Our Lead Developer

This approach has allowed us to reduce our development cycle times by approximately 30% compared to industry standards, meaning we can deliver improvements and new features to our customers faster than ever.

## How Dogfooding Translates to Better Customer Experiences

### Real-World Problem Solving

Because we use our products in real business scenarios, we develop solutions for actual problems rather than hypothetical use cases. When we built our automated reporting features, we did so because our own management team was spending too much time compiling data manually. The resulting solution wasn't just technically sound—it addressed a genuine business need that we knew our customers shared.

### Documentation That Actually Makes Sense

One of the most common complaints about business software is poor documentation. When our team writes help content, they do so from the perspective of actual users who have encountered the same questions and challenges our customers might face. Our support tickets related to documentation confusion have decreased by 47% since implementing this approach.

### Training That Reflects Real Usage

Our customer onboarding and training materials benefit tremendously from our dogfooding approach. When we train new clients on our systems, we can share authentic examples of how we use the software ourselves, including specific workflows, shortcuts, and best practices that have emerged from our daily usage.

A client recently told us: "It's refreshing to get training from people who actually use the software every day. The tips you shared weren't in any manual, but they've saved us hours of work."

## Case Study: How Dogfooding Transformed Our Project Management Tool

To illustrate the impact of our approach, let's look at a specific example from our product lineup: our project management solution.

### The Challenge

Initially designed with traditional waterfall project methodologies in mind, our tool was structured around linear progression through predetermined stages. On paper, it looked comprehensive and robust.

### The Reality Check

When our own development team—who follows an agile methodology—began using the tool, they immediately encountered friction. The rigid structure didn't accommodate their need for sprints, backlog management, and rapid iteration. What's more, they found themselves creating workarounds and using supplementary tools to manage their workflow.

### The Transformation

Rather than continuing with the original vision, we pivoted based on this internal feedback. The development team became the primary stakeholders in redesigning the tool, incorporating:

- Flexible methodology options (Agile, Waterfall, and hybrid approaches)
- Customizable workflows that adapt to different team structures
- Integrated backlog management and sprint planning
- Real-time collaboration features inspired by our own remote work needs

### The Results

The redesigned tool not only eliminated the need for our team to use multiple solutions but also resonated strongly with our customers. Adoption rates increased by 78%, and customer satisfaction scores for this product rose from 7.2 to 9.1 out of 10.

This example demonstrates how dogfooding prevented us from releasing a product that looked good in theory but would have failed to meet real-world needs. Instead, we created something that genuinely solved problems because we experienced those problems ourselves.

## The Challenges of Dogfooding (And How We Address Them)

While we're strong advocates for eating our own dogfood, we recognize that this approach comes with certain challenges that must be managed carefully.

### 1. Avoiding Echo Chamber Effects

When you're both the creator and the user, there's a risk of developing tunnel vision based on your specific needs. To counter this, we:

- Maintain diverse internal user groups with different workflows and requirements
- Regularly compare our usage patterns with customer analytics
- Conduct external usability testing to complement our internal feedback

### 2. Balancing Internal and External Priorities

Sometimes what our team needs most urgently differs from what the broader market requires. We manage this tension by:

- Using a weighted scoring system for feature prioritization that balances internal needs with market demands
- Maintaining separate development tracks for internal tools versus customer-facing features when necessary
- Ensuring product decisions are informed by both internal feedback and market research

### 3. Managing the Disruption of Updates

When you're constantly improving your products, internal teams can experience "update fatigue" from frequent changes to their tools. We address this by:

- Implementing staged rollouts internally before customer releases
- Providing comprehensive change management support for our own teams
- Collecting structured feedback on how updates impact productivity

By acknowledging and addressing these challenges, we ensure that our dogfooding practice remains a strength rather than a limitation.

## How Our Dogfooding Benefits You

## Conclusion: Authenticity as a Competitive Advantage

In a market flooded with software solutions making grand promises, our commitment to eating our own dogfood provides something increasingly rare: authenticity. We don't just claim our products can solve business problems—we rely on them to solve our own.

This practice has become more than just a quality assurance strategy; it's a cornerstone of our company culture and a key differentiator in how we develop and deliver solutions. By experiencing our products as users first and developers second, we create tools that truly work in the messy reality of day-to-day business operations.

If you're evaluating technology partners, we encourage you to ask this simple question: "Do they use their own products?" The answer reveals volumes about a company's confidence in what they're selling and their commitment to quality.

At Common Sense Systems, the answer is an emphatic yes—we wouldn't have it any other way. And we believe this commitment is one of the most valuable things we bring to our client relationships.
