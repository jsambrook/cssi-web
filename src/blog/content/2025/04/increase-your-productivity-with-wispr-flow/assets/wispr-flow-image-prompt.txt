Create a professional marketing graphic with dimensions 1024x1024 for a blog post about Wispr Flow voice dictation software.

The graphic should include:
1. A headline at the top reading "Increase Your Productivity with Wispr Flow"
2. A split-screen visual showing:
   - Left side: A professional looking frustrated while typing on a keyboard with thought bubbles containing jumbled, incomplete ideas
   - Right side: The same professional looking relaxed and confident, speaking naturally with a visualized sound wave transforming into clean, organized text on their screen

Use a modern, clean design with a professional color palette of blues and teals. Include plenty of white space for clear readability.

Add a small tagline at the bottom: "Speak naturally. Write faster."

The style should be professional and somewhat minimalist, appropriate for a business audience interested in productivity tools. Avoid overly cartoonish elements while still making the contrast between typing and speaking visually clear.
