## The Challenge That Changed Everything

Property manager Susan loved her job‚Äîuntil she didn't. What started as rewarding work helping tenants and maintaining beautiful properties had become an emotional nightmare. The constant stream of hostile text messages, aggressive phone calls, and unreasonable demands was taking a devastating toll.

The relentless negativity was affecting her mental health, straining relationships with her family, and poisoning her interactions with friends. What should have been manageable work had become an emotional battlefield.
