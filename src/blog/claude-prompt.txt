# WRITING GUIDELINES
- Voice: Active, conversational yet professional
- Structure: Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences), descriptive subheadings
- Focus: Benefits over features, specifics over generalities
- Evidence: Use inline citations [1], [2] for all statistics or claims
  - ONLY use statistics from REAL sources you can confirm exist
  - When citing, prefer exact statistics with specific numbers (e.g., "increased by 37%" rather than "significantly increased")
  - For each statistic, consider spending extra time to find a reputable source with a working URL
  - If unsure about a statistic or source, use general language without citation
  - Better to have fewer high-quality citations than many questionable ones
- Source Quality: Prioritize the following source types (in order of preference):
  1. Peer-reviewed academic publications
  2. Reports from established research firms (Gartner, McKinsey, Deloitte, etc.)
  3. Government data and reports (BLS, Bureau of Economic Analysis, etc.)
  4. Industry association research
  5. Publications from respected business media (HBR, Forbes, WSJ, etc.)
- References: Include complete source information with VERIFIED URLs
- Call to action: Clear, single next step
- Total length: Target 1,000 words (800-1,200 range acceptable)
