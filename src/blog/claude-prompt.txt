# WRITING GUIDELINES
- Voice: Active, conversational yet professional
- Structure: Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences), descriptive subheadings
- Focus: Benefits over features, specifics over generalities
- Technical Terminology:
  - When introducing industry-specific terms or acronyms (e.g., RPA, ML, etc.), provide a brief definition
  - For key technical concepts, include a citation to an authoritative definition source
  - Example: "Robotic Process Automation (RPA), the technology that uses software robots to automate repetitive tasks [3], can reduce..."
  - Always assume the reader is unfamiliar with specialized terminology
  - For acronyms, always spell out the full term on first use with the acronym in parentheses
- Evidence: Use inline citations [1], [2] for all statistics or claims
  - ONLY use statistics from REAL sources you can confirm exist
  - When citing, prefer exact statistics with specific numbers (e.g., "increased by 37%" rather than "significantly increased")
  - For each statistic, consider spending extra time to find a reputable source with a working URL
  - If unsure about a statistic or source, use general language without citation
  - Better to have fewer high-quality citations than many questionable ones
- Source Quality: Prioritize the following source types (in order of preference):
  1. Peer-reviewed academic publications
  2. Reports from established research firms (Gartner, McKinsey, Deloitte, etc.)
  3. Government data and reports (BLS, Bureau of Economic Analysis, etc.)
  4. Industry association research
  5. Publications from respected business media (HBR, Forbes, WSJ, etc.)
  6. Well-established resources like Wikipedia for basic definitions (acceptable for terminology only)
- References: 
  - Include complete source information with VERIFIED URLs
  - For each URL, carefully verify that:
    * The domain is a legitimate, established website
    * The URL follows proper structure with no unusual characters
    * The URL points to a specific page, not just a homepage
    * The resource is publicly accessible (not behind a paywall or login)
    * The resource is likely to remain stable and accessible
  - After including a URL, mentally verify that it would work if someone typed it in a browser
  - Avoid references to temporary pages, social media posts, or pages likely to change
  - For AI-related topics, prioritize URLs from the last 2-3 years (since 2022)
- Call to action: Clear, single next step
- Total length: Target 1,000 words (800-1,200 range acceptable)
