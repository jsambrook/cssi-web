          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Across 10 nursing collective bargaining agreements, we identified
            <strong class="text-primary">134 distinct structural conflicts</strong>&mdash;clauses
            that create impossible dilemmas for nurses, managers, or both. These aren't ambiguities
            or edge cases. They're built-in contradictions where complying with one provision
            necessarily violates another.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Of these 134 conflicts, <strong>four appear in every single agreement analyzed.</strong>
            They are not hospital-specific. They are structural features of how nursing work is contracted
            in Washington State.

        <h2>The 4 Universal Conflicts</h2>
        <p>
          These conflicts were present in all 10 agreements&mdash;across union locals, hospital
          sizes, and geographic regions. Each represents a genuine dilemma with no clean resolution
          under the current contract structure.

        <!-- Premium Pay Fallacy -->
        <h2>The "Premium Pay" Fallacy</h2>
        <p>
          The most common contractual response to these conflicts is money. Missed a break? Here's
          premium pay. Got floated? Here's a differential. Called in on your day off? Here's
          overtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          This pattern appeared across virtually every agreement we analyzed. It reveals a
          fundamental misunderstanding of the problem:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Premium pay monetizes the conflict rather than evaporating it.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Paying a nurse extra for a missed meal break doesn't solve the problem of the missed meal
          break. It compensates for the harm while leaving the structural cause intact. The nurse is
          still exhausted. The patient safety risk is still real. The conflict recurs on the next
          shift.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worse, premium pay creates a perverse incentive: the <em>contract itself</em> becomes more expensive
          to honor than to violate, which encourages systematic non-compliance masked by financial settlements.
        </p>

        <!-- Strategic Implication -->
        <h2>The Strategic Implication</h2>
        <p>
          Every health system in Washington is competing for the same nursing workforce. Most
          compete on wages. The data from this analysis suggests a different strategy:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >A health system that structurally resolves even one of these four universal conflicts
            will differentiate itself more than one offering a 2% higher wage.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          For example: a hospital that implements <em>guaranteed break relief</em>&mdash;not as a
          policy aspiration but as a staffed, funded, operationally real program&mdash;would
          eliminate Conflict&nbsp;1 entirely. Nurses wouldn't face the daily dilemma. The grievance
          pipeline around missed breaks would dry up. And the hospital would become known as the
          place where breaks actually happen.
        </p>
        <p>That's a structural advantage no wage premium can replicate.</p>
