The biggest risk in any initiative isn't building the wrong thing. It's building the right thing too slowly to matter.

Large programs fail for a predictable reason: they defer learning. The plan is set, the timeline is long, and by the time something ships, the context has changed. The work is technically complete but practically irrelevant.

## The case for short cycles

Short cycles—two to four weeks of focused work ending in something measurable—solve this problem by compressing the feedback loop. Instead of planning for six months and delivering once, you plan for two weeks and deliver continuously.

This isn't just an engineering practice. It applies to strategy, operations, and organizational change.

## What a short cycle looks like

A well-run short cycle has four elements:

1. **A clear outcome.** Not "make progress on the initiative." A specific, measurable result: "Reduce ticket backlog by 15%" or "Ship the revised onboarding flow to 10% of users."
2. **A bounded scope.** The work fits in the cycle. If it doesn't, the scope is wrong—not the timeline.
3. **A review at the end.** Did we hit the outcome? If yes, what did we learn? If no, why not? This takes 30 minutes, not a half-day retrospective.
4. **An adjustment.** Based on what you learned, what changes for the next cycle?

## Why organizations resist this

Short cycles feel uncomfortable because they surface problems early. A two-week cycle that misses its target is visible in a way that a six-month program drifting off course is not.

That visibility is the point. Problems you see early are problems you can fix. Problems you discover at the end of a long program are expensive, demoralizing, and often unfixable.

## Getting started

Pick one initiative. Define a two-week outcome. Execute. Review. Adjust. Repeat.

You don't need a framework or a methodology. You need the discipline to ship something real every two weeks and the honesty to evaluate whether it mattered.
