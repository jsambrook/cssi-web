A reflection on Lean's definition of value, arguing that no work is neutral—activities either create value, enable it through necessary conditions, or subtract it as waste.

"In Lean, value is defined very specifically: it is what the customer perceives as worth paying for. The Lean Enterprise Institute's lexicon is clear—value-creating work is that which changes the product or service in ways the customer values, and everything else is non-value-creating.

That definition has been enormously influential. But in practice—especially in regulated industries like healthcare, aerospace, and medical devices—things are more complicated.

## Beyond "Value-Added" vs. "Non-Value-Added"

When most people hear *non-value-added work*, they assume the activity is simply *neutral*. After all, it's "not value-added"—so maybe it doesn't help, but it doesn't hurt either.

In reality, no activity is neutral. Every task consumes resources, time, and attention. That means every task either:

- Creates value directly for customers,
- Enables the conditions under which value can be delivered, or
- Subtracts value outright by wasting resources.

## The Hidden Middle: Enabling Conditions

Here's where practice diverges from theory. Lean is right to insist that customers define value. But if you're bringing a medical device to market, regulatory compliance is not optional. Customers don't buy the giant submission binder—but without it, they can't buy the product at all.

That makes compliance, safety checks, and other "necessary non-value-added" activities a different category. They are *enabling conditions*. They don't add value in the customer's eyes, but they are essential for the business to remain a going concern and to deliver value safely.

## Reconciling Purist Lean with Pragmatic Reality

Let's compare the two views:

| **LEI Lexicon (Purist Lean)** | **Pragmatic Lean / TOC View** |
|---|---|
| Value = only what the customer perceives and will pay for | Value = what the customer perceives *plus* what enables safe, legal, reliable delivery |
| Value-Creating = activities judged by customer as worth paying for | Direct Value = same as LEI |
| Nonvalue-Creating = all else; adds cost without value | Split into: 1. Enabling Conditions (compliance, safety, regulatory) 2. Waste (rework, delays, unnecessary motion) |
| Goal: eliminate nonvalue-creating work | Goal: eliminate *waste*, streamline *enabling conditions*, and maximize *direct value* |

## Why This Matters

In highly regulated environments, treating all non-value-added work as waste is misleading. It obscures the difference between activities that are *essential conditions of market access* and those that are *truly wasteful*.

By making this distinction explicit, leaders can direct improvement efforts more effectively:

- Streamline and simplify **enabling conditions** rather than fighting them,
- Ruthlessly eliminate **waste**, and
- Invest in maximizing **direct value**.

## Closing Thought

Lean's sharp definition of value is a gift—it keeps us honest about what customers really care about. But it's equally important to acknowledge that no work is neutral. Every activity either creates value, enables it, or subtracts from it.

The challenge is to tell the difference—and to focus your energy accordingly.
