Most organizational arguments aren't about strategy. They're about facts. Two leaders in the same room, looking at different dashboards, drawing different conclusions, and talking past each other.

The conventional fix is "Data Governance" or "Business Intelligence." Build a bigger warehouse. Visualize it better.

But from a systems perspective, the problem isn't a lack of data. It's a lack of **Theory**.

## The Theory of the Business

Without a clear theory of how your system generates value (e.g., Theory of Constraints), every metric looks equally important.

- The Lab Manager optimizes for "Test Cost per Unit."
- The OR Director optimizes for "Room Utilization."
- The CFO optimizes for "Days Cash on Hand."

These are **Local Optima**. And as Goldratt taught us, a system composed of efficient parts is rarely an efficient system. In fact, maximizing local efficiency often _destroys_ global throughput. (If the Lab cuts costs by batching tests, they delay the ED, which boards patients, which blocks the OR).

## The Minimum Dataset

A "Minimum Dataset" isn't just a shorter list of numbers. It is the specific set of metrics that tell you if the **Global Constraint** is healthy.

For a hospital, that might not be 50 KPIs. It might be three:

1. **Throughput:** How many patients are successfully completing their care journey today?
2. **Inventory:** How many patients are stuck in the system (waiting for beds, labs, or discharge)?
3. **Operating Expense:** What is the actual run-rate cost of keeping the doors open?

## How to Align the Room

To stop the dashboard wars, we stop asking "What can we measure?" and start asking "What is the Constraint?"

1. **Identify the Constraint:** Is it the ED? The OR? Staffing?
2. **Subordinate the Data:** If a metric doesn't tell us about the Constraint, it is secondary. Move it to the appendix.
3. **Kill the Vanity Metrics:** Any number that looks good but doesn't drive a decision is noise.

The shift from "Presentation Ready" (looking thorough) to "Decision Ready" (looking clear) requires the courage to ignore 90% of the data. You don't need a better dashboard. You need a better theory.
