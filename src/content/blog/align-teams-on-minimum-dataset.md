Most organizational arguments aren't about strategy. They're about facts. Two leaders in the same room, looking at different dashboards, drawing different conclusions, and talking past each other.

The fix isn't more data. It's agreeing on less.

## What is a minimum dataset?

A minimum dataset is the smallest set of facts that everyone in the room trusts enough to make decisions from. It's not a dashboard. It's not a data warehouse. It's a short, curated list of numbers that answer the questions that actually matter.

## Why teams resist it

Building a minimum dataset forces uncomfortable conversations:

- **"Which metrics actually matter?"** Most teams track too many things and act on too few.
- **"Do we trust this number?"** Often the answer is no, and no one has said it out loud.
- **"What are we willing to stop measuring?"** Letting go of a metric feels like losing visibility, even when the metric drives no decisions.

## How to build one

1. **Start with the decision.** What are you trying to decide in the next 30 days? That frames which facts matter.
2. **List candidate metrics.** Ask each stakeholder: "What would you need to see to feel confident deciding?"
3. **Negotiate down.** The goal is five to seven metrics, not fifty. Every metric on the list should change a decision if it moves.
4. **Validate sources.** For each metric, confirm: where does this number come from? Do we trust it? If not, fix the source before proceeding.
5. **Publish and review.** Make the minimum dataset visible to everyone involved. Review it weekly. Update it only when the decision context changes.

The minimum dataset isn't a permanent artifact. It's a tool for the current moment. When the decision changes, the dataset changes too.
