# Common Sense Presentation for EvergreenHealth

## Introduction
The objective of this work is to build a highly compelling web
presentation for EvergreenHealth. I would like to create a business
relationship between Common Sense (CS) and EvergreenHealth (EH); I
would like to recruit EH as a client of CS.

The presentation is to be built as a modern web presentation using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the appropriate JavaScript libraries to
enable a highly compelling presentation. The presentation should be
viewable on either a mobile device or on a laptop or ordinary
workstation.

The presentation should have about ten top-level pages, connected with
navigation buttons at the bottom of each top-level page.
