# BARD: AI Tools Are Only Half the Equation

## Blog Article Requirements Document

### Article Title

**Why Your AI Tools Are Only Half the Equation**

### Target Slug

`ai-tools-half-the-equation`

### Purpose

Show that AI is powerful but useless without knowing which problems to solve. Constraint thinking, not technology, is the real differentiator. Use John's own business as the example: cutting SaaS, rethinking cost structure, and redirecting resources toward throughput.

### Target Audience

Small business owners who are excited about AI but don't have a clear framework for deciding where to apply it. They're buying tools without a strategy.

### Author Voice

Write as John Sambrook, founder of Common Sense Systems, Inc. in Kirkland, Washington. Systems thinker, constraints management expert, business owner who has been programming AI agents full-time since January 2025. This article shows vulnerability: John's revenue dropped from $250K to around $10K, and he used that constraint to force clarity about what actually matters.

### Author Description Guidance

Refer to John as: founder, systems thinker, constraints management expert, business owner. This article bridges AI and business strategy, so avoid any single-industry label.

### Core Argument

Every small business owner is hearing about AI. Most are either paralyzed by choice or buying tools that don't solve the right problem. The secret isn't the AI. It's knowing what to apply it to. John used constraint thinking to analyze his own business, identified where money was leaking (SaaS subscriptions, bandwidth costs), where time was being wasted (bookkeeping, scheduling), and where effort should be redirected (sales conversations, relationship building). The AI tools made execution faster. The constraint thinking made the strategy right.

### Key Points to Cover

- The AI hype problem: everyone says "use AI" but nobody tells you which problem to solve first.
- John's story: revenue dropped, which forced a hard look at where time and money were actually going.
- The constraint identification process: what's actually limiting my throughput? Is it technology? No. Is it capability? No. It's sales conversations. Everything else is subordinate to that constraint.
- Once you know the constraint, AI becomes a lever: automate bookkeeping (saves time for sales), cancel unnecessary SaaS (saves money), build content (attracts prospects).
- The trap: buying AI tools without constraint thinking is just automating waste.
- The Kirkland consulting firm example: Common Sense Systems didn't adopt AI because it was trendy. They adopted it because it directly addressed their binding constraint.

### Geographic References

Reference Kirkland, Puget Sound, Seattle tech scene. Example: "In the Puget Sound tech corridor, it's easy to get caught up in AI hype. Every other pitch deck in Bellevue mentions machine learning. But most small businesses in Kirkland and Redmond don't need machine learning. They need five more sales conversations a month."

### Calls to Action
