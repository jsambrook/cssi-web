# BARD: How I Automated My Bookkeeping

## Blog Article Requirements Document

### Article Title

**How I Automated My Bookkeeping and Found Ten Hours a Month for Sales**

### Target Slug

`automated-bookkeeping-ai-coding-agents`

### Purpose

Show small business owners a real example of using AI coding agents (Claude Code + BeanCount) to replace a paid SaaS subscription (QuickBooks) and reclaim time previously spent on bookkeeping. The real value isn't the software savings, it's the time redirected to revenue-generating activity.

### Target Audience

Small business owners and solopreneurs who are paying for bookkeeping software, spending hours on admin, and feeling like they never have enough time for actual sales and client work.

### Author Voice

Write as John Sambrook, founder of Common Sense Systems, Inc. in Kirkland, Washington. This is a first-person account of something John actually did. Honest, practical, showing both the wins and the learning curve. John is a business owner, systems engineer, and someone who uses AI tools daily. He's not a finance person. He's an engineer who figured out a better way.

### Author Description Guidance

Refer to John as: founder, business owner, systems engineer, small business owner. Emphasize that he's been programming AI agents full-time since January 2025. Do NOT describe as "healthcare consultant" in this article.

### Core Argument

Most small business owners treat bookkeeping as a necessary evil. They either pay an accountant, pay for QuickBooks, or dread doing it themselves. But AI coding agents have changed the math. John canceled QuickBooks and replaced it with BeanCount (open-source double-entry accounting) driven by Claude Code. The bookkeeping now takes a fraction of the time, and the ten hours a month he saved went straight into sales activity. The real insight: every hour you spend on admin is an hour you're not increasing throughput.

### Key Points to Cover

- The before: QuickBooks subscription, hours spent reconciling, time that should have gone to sales.
- The decision: why cancel QuickBooks? Because Google Workspace already handles most business needs, and AI coding agents can automate the rest.
- The how: BeanCount basics, how Claude Code generates and validates entries, what the workflow looks like day-to-day.
- The real win: not the subscription cost saved (though that matters), but the time reclaimed for revenue-generating activity.
- The broader pattern: this is one of 5-10 SaaS subscriptions John has eliminated or is eliminating. Calendly to Google Calendar is another example. The Internet bill renegotiation.
- The mindset shift: from "I can afford this" to "does this subscription actually earn its keep?"
- Connect to throughput: in Theory of Constraints terms, every dollar and hour spent on admin that doesn't increase throughput is waste.

### Geographic References

Reference Kirkland, the Puget Sound region. Example: "Running a small consulting firm in Kirkland means every dollar and every hour counts, especially in a year where revenue dropped significantly."

### Style Notes

- This is a first-person narrative. "I did this, here's what happened."
- Show the actual before/after. Be specific about costs, time, and what changed.
- Don't make it sound effortless. Acknowledge the learning curve with BeanCount.
- The punchline is not about bookkeeping. It's about what you do with the time you get back.
