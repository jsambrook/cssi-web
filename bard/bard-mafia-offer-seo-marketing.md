## Blog Article Requirements Document

### Article Title
**Stop Selling Rankings, Start Selling Revenue: The Unrefusable Offer for SEO Agencies**

### Target Slug
`mafia-offer-seo-digital-marketing`

### Purpose
Show SEO and digital marketing agencies that their customers don't want rankings. They want phone calls and sales conversations. Build the mafia offer around actual business outcomes, not vanity metrics. Also serves as a cautionary tale for business owners hiring SEO firms.

### Target Audience
SEO professionals, digital marketing agency owners, and small business owners evaluating or frustrated with their current SEO provider.

### Author Voice
Write as John Sambrook, founder of Common Sense Systems, Inc. in Kirkland, Washington. John had a real SEO provider (Dan) who was reluctant to promise business outcomes. John's position: he doesn't care about Google rankings. He wants five selling conversations a month on his calendar, or the monthly fee is refunded. That's the mafia offer for SEO.

### Author Description Guidance
Refer to John as: founder, business owner, systems thinker, constraints management expert. This is a cross-industry article. Do NOT limit to any single industry label.

### Core Argument
Every SEO agency promises page one rankings. Business owners don't want rankings. They want their phone to ring with qualified buyers. The core problem: SEO providers sell what they can measure (rankings, traffic, impressions) rather than what the customer actually cares about (sales conversations, revenue).

John's personal mafia offer demand to his SEO provider: "I want five selling conversations a month on my calendar. That's what I'm paying you for. If my calendar doesn't have five qualified meetings, you don't get paid that month."

Most SEO providers won't take that deal because it forces them to understand the client's business, not just their keywords.

### Key Points to Cover
- The real story: John's experience with Dan, who was reluctant to tie his fee to business outcomes.
- The core problem: SEO providers sell rankings. Business owners want revenue. The gap is enormous.
- Why most SEO firms resist outcome-based pricing: they'd have to understand the client's sales process, conversion funnel, and customer profile, not just keyword density.
- The unrefusable offer: "Five qualified sales conversations per month on your calendar, or your fee is refunded."
- What an SEO provider must do to make this work: understand the client's business deeply, create content that attracts qualified buyers (not just traffic), optimize for conversion (not just ranking), and track actual business outcomes.
- The payoff: an SEO agency that guarantees sales conversations will dominate because everyone else is still selling rankings.
- Connect to the generative AI search shift: rankings are becoming less relevant as AI agents change how people find businesses.

### Geographic References
Reference Kirkland, Seattle, Puget Sound. Example: "If you're an SEO agency in Seattle promising page one rankings, ask yourself: does your client in Kirkland actually care where they rank, or do they care that their phone rings?"
