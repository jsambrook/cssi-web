### Article Title

**Nobody Cares About Your Uptime Percentage: Building an Unrefusable Offer for Managed IT**

### Target Slug

`mafia-offer-managed-it-services`

### Purpose

Show managed IT service providers that their customers don't care about uptime percentages or ticket metrics. Customers care about one thing: will my systems work when I need them, and when they break, will someone actually answer the phone? Build the mafia offer around that reality.

### Target Audience

Managed IT service providers, MSPs, and IT consultants who serve small and mid-size businesses. Also resonates with business owners who are frustrated with their current IT provider.

### Author Voice

Write as John Sambrook, founder of Common Sense Systems, Inc. in Kirkland, Washington. John has 30+ years in systems engineering, including embedded systems, medical devices, and Linux kernel work. He understands technology deeply but writes for business owners, not technicians.

### Author Description Guidance

Refer to John as: founder, systems engineer, systems thinker, constraints management expert, business owner. His technical background gives this article extra credibility. Do NOT limit to "healthcare consultant."

### Core Argument

IT vendors talk about 99.9% uptime. Business owners care about: "will my systems work when I need them?" and "when something breaks, will you actually answer the phone or will I spend two hours in queue?" The core problem is that IT providers sell technical metrics while customers want business outcomes: productivity, reliability, and responsiveness.

Mafia offer: "Five-minute response time, guaranteed. If we miss it, your entire monthly fee is refunded and we credit you double the cost of that outage against next month's bill." That forces a vendor to staff differently, invest in monitoring and automation, and actually care about response time.

### Key Points to Cover

- The core problem: IT providers sell uptime percentages. Business owners want their systems to just work, and when they don't, they want someone to pick up the phone immediately.
- The disconnect between IT metrics and business reality.
- What customers actually experience: long hold times, ticket queues, "we'll escalate it," scheduled maintenance windows that disrupt work.
- The unrefusable offer: five-minute response time guaranteed, or full monthly fee refunded plus double credit.
- What the IT provider must do to make this work: proactive monitoring, automated alerting, adequate staffing, runbooks for common issues, investment in redundancy.
- The payoff: an MSP that can guarantee five-minute response times will dominate their market because no one else is willing to stake their revenue on responsiveness.
- Brief mention of the broader managed services productivity guarantee: guarantee that the client's team spends less than two hours monthly on IT issues, or the retainer is reduced.

### Geographic References

Reference Kirkland, Bellevue, Redmond, Seattle. Example: "In the Redmond-Bellevue tech corridor, there's no shortage of MSPs. They all promise 'enterprise-grade support.' But ask any small business owner in Kirkland how long they waited on hold last time their email went down."

1200-1800 words.

### Style Notes

- Contrast with the five-minute guarantee experience.
- Keep it accessible to non-technical business owners. No jargon.
