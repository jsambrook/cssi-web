### Article Title
**The Three-Way Email Paradox: Why Warm Introductions Beat Your Entire LinkedIn Network**

### Target Slug
`three-way-email-paradox`

### Purpose
Convince small business owners that a small number of genuine advocates who make warm three-way email introductions will outperform a massive cold network every time. Show the math. Make it concrete.

### Target Audience
Small business owners, solopreneurs, consultants, and service professionals in the Puget Sound region and beyond who are struggling to generate sales conversations despite having a large network.

### Author Voice
Write as John Sambrook, founder of Common Sense Systems, Inc. in Kirkland, Washington. John is a systems thinker and business owner with 30+ years of engineering and consulting experience. He is direct, practical, and allergic to vague advice. He talks in concrete terms, real examples, and cause-and-effect reasoning. Avoid abstract frameworks without grounding them first in specific experience.

### Author Description Guidance
Do NOT describe John solely as a "healthcare consultant." In this article, refer to him as appropriate combinations of: founder, business owner, systems thinker, constraints management expert, small business owner. The point is that John practices what he preaches in his own business.

### Core Argument
Most business owners think a bigger network equals more opportunity. It doesn't. A network of 500 LinkedIn connections who vaguely know you is worth less than 12 people who genuinely understand what you do and will pick up the phone or write a three-way email to introduce you. The three-way email intro works because it's low friction for the introducer and carries social proof for the recipient.

### Key Points to Cover
- The math: 12 advocates x 50 contacts each = 600 warm introductions. Compare conversion rates of warm vs. cold outreach (warm intros convert at roughly 40-50%, cold outreach at 1-2%).
- What a three-way email intro actually looks like. Give a real example.
- Why it works: the introducer puts their reputation on the line, the recipient sees social proof, and the ask is specific.
- Why big networks fail: vague connections, no context, no social proof. Being "connected" on LinkedIn means nothing if nobody knows what you actually do.
- How to build a small network of genuine advocates rather than chasing follower counts.
- Mention BNI (Business Network International) as a structured example of this principle in action.

### Geographic References
Weave in references to Kirkland, Bellevue, Redmond, Seattle, and the Puget Sound region naturally. Example: "In the Kirkland and Bellevue business community, word of mouth still drives most of the deals that actually close."

### Calls to Action
Include 2-3 calls to action throughout the article:
- Mid-article: "If you're a small business owner in the Seattle area trying to figure out why your network isn't generating sales conversations, let's talk. [Link to contact page or calendar]"
- End of article: "Common Sense Systems helps business owners identify what's actually constraining their growth. Book a free consultation. [Link]"

### Length
1200-1800 words. No padding. Every paragraph should earn its place.

### Style Notes
- Lead with a concrete scenario, not an abstract principle.
- Use real numbers and real examples.
- Avoid jargon. If you use a term like "conversion rate," define it immediately.
- No bullet-point-heavy formatting. Write in prose with occasional lists where they genuinely help.
- Don't lecture. Write like you're explaining this to a friend over coffee.
