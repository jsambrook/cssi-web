# BARD: Getting Found by AI Agents

## Blog Article Requirements Document

### Article Title
**How Small Businesses Get Found by AI Agents (Not Just Google)**

### Target Slug
`how-small-businesses-get-found-by-ai-agents`

### Purpose
Educate small business owners that generative AI search is fundamentally changing how customers find businesses. AI agents don't crawl keywords like Google. They reason, evaluate authority, and look for specificity and demonstrated expertise. Businesses that optimize for this now will dominate discovery when it fully matures.

### Target Audience
Small business owners, marketing directors, and anyone responsible for getting their business found online. This article serves double duty: it educates about generative search AND positions Common Sense Systems as someone already doing it.

### Author Voice
Write as John Sambrook, founder of Common Sense Systems, Inc. in Kirkland, Washington. John has been programming AI agents full-time since January 2025. He understands how AI models evaluate content because he builds with them daily. Systems engineer, systems thinker, business owner. Direct and practical.

### Author Description Guidance
Refer to John as: founder, systems engineer, AI practitioner, business owner. Emphasize that he builds with AI daily, not just writes about it. Do NOT limit to any single industry label.

### Core Argument
Google ranks pages. AI agents evaluate authority, specificity, and demonstrated expertise. They don't just match keywords. They reason about whether a business actually knows what it's talking about. This means the old SEO playbook (keyword density, backlinks, meta tags) is necessary but no longer sufficient.

Small businesses that want to be found by AI agents need to:
1. Demonstrate genuine expertise in their content (not keyword-stuffed fluff).
2. Be specific about what they do, who they serve, and where they operate.
3. Structure their content clearly so AI agents can parse and reason about it.
4. Publish content that shows real experience, not just recycled advice.

### Key Points to Cover
- The shift: traditional search (Google, Bing) vs. generative AI search (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, AI assistants).
- How AI agents evaluate content differently: they look for specificity, demonstrated expertise, clear structure, and authority. They can detect generic content and deprioritize it.
- Why keyword stuffing doesn't work for AI agents. They understand meaning, not just words.
- Practical steps for small businesses:
  - Write content that shows real experience and specific examples.
  - Include geographic specificity (city, region, service area).
  - Use structured data (JSON-LD) so AI agents can understand your content programmatically.
  - Publish consistently on topics where you have genuine authority.
  - Make your meta information specific and descriptive, not generic.
  - Include author information and credentials.
- The competitive advantage: most small businesses aren't thinking about this yet. Early movers own the space.
- The Common Sense Systems example: this very blog is optimized for both traditional search and AI agent discovery. That's the proof point.
- What good meta information looks like vs. bad. Give real examples.
- JSON-LD: what it is, why it matters, and how small businesses can implement it.

### Geographic References
Reference Kirkland, Bellevue, Redmond, Seattle, Puget Sound throughout. Example: "If someone asks an AI assistant 'who helps small businesses with constraints management in Kirkland?' your content needs to be specific enough that the AI can confidently recommend you."

### Length
1800-2500 words. This is educational content that needs depth.

### Style Notes
- Open with a scenario: someone asks ChatGPT or Claude to recommend a contractor in Bellevue. What determines whether your business shows up?
- Make it practical. Not "AI is changing everything." Instead: "Here are five things you can do this week to be more discoverable."
- Use before/after examples of meta descriptions, JSON-LD, and content structure.
- This article itself should be a demonstration of the principles it teaches.
- End with: "The businesses that figure this out now will own their market when everyone else catches up."
