### Article Title

**Stop Chasing Commissions, Start Saving Money: The Unrefusable Offer for Insurance Agencies**

### Target Slug

`mafia-offer-insurance-agencies`

### Purpose

Show insurance agency owners that their core problem is commission-driven distrust. Customers assume agents are selling them whatever pays the highest commission, not what's best for them. Build the mafia offer around measurable savings and an alignment of incentives.

### Target Audience

Independent insurance agents, agency owners, and business owners who are skeptical about their current insurance coverage.

### Author Voice

Write as John Sambrook, founder of Common Sense Systems, Inc. in Kirkland, Washington. Systems thinker, constraints management expert, business owner. Practical, direct, no-nonsense.

### Author Description Guidance

Refer to John as: founder, systems thinker, constraints management expert, business owner. Do NOT limit to any single industry label.

### Core Argument

Customers think insurance agents are commission chasers who'll sell them anything to make a buck. They don't believe agents actually have their interests in mind. The core problem is a misalignment of incentives: the agent profits from selling more coverage, not from saving the customer money.

Mafia offer: "We'll audit your current coverage against your actual risk profile. If we can't save you at least twenty percent annually while maintaining or improving your coverage, we won't take your business. You only pay us if we deliver measurable savings."

This forces the agency to develop genuine risk assessment capability, invest in understanding each client's actual needs, and walk away from clients they can't genuinely help.

### Key Points to Cover

- The core problem: commission-driven distrust. Customers assume the agent is selling them more than they need.
- The customer experience: confusion about what they're actually covered for, suspicion about whether they're paying too much, inability to compare options meaningfully.
- Why insurance agencies haven't solved this: the commission model rewards selling, not saving. Agents who save clients money make less.
- The unrefusable offer: twenty percent savings guarantee, or the agency doesn't take the business.
- What the agency must do: develop real risk assessment tools, invest time in understanding each client's actual exposure, be willing to recommend less coverage when appropriate, shift from commission-driven to value-driven revenue model.
- The payoff: an agency that guarantees savings earns trust immediately. Referrals skyrocket because clients tell everyone "my agent actually saved me money instead of trying to sell me more."
- The structural shift: agencies that can make this offer typically move toward fee-based advisory models rather than pure commission models.

### Geographic References

Reference Kirkland, Bellevue, Seattle, Washington State. Example: "In Washington State, insurance is required for everything from your car to your business. Every business owner in Kirkland and Bellevue is paying premiums. The question is whether they're paying the right amount for the right coverage."

### Style Notes

- Open with the customer's internal monologue when meeting an insurance agent. The skepticism is real.
- Show that the agent isn't a villain. They're trapped in a system that rewards the wrong behavior.
- The mafia offer realigns incentives. That's the structural fix.
