# BARD: The Specificity Trap

## Blog Article Requirements Document

### Article Title

**The Specificity Trap: Why "Can You Introduce Me to Someone?" Fails Every Time**

### Target Slug

`specificity-trap-introductions`

### Purpose

Show small business owners that vague networking asks kill introductions before they start. Demonstrate exactly what a specific ask looks like versus a generic one, and why specificity makes it easier for your advocate to actually help you.

### Target Audience

Small business owners, consultants, and service professionals who attend networking events and BNI meetings but aren't getting the introductions that turn into business.

### Author Voice

Write as John Sambrook, founder of Common Sense Systems, Inc. in Kirkland, Washington. Direct, practical, zero tolerance for vague advice. Grounded in real experience from BNI meetings and local business networking in the Puget Sound area.

### Author Description Guidance

Refer to John as: founder, business owner, systems thinker, small business owner. Do NOT limit to "healthcare consultant."

### Core Argument

When you ask someone "do you know anyone who might need my services?" you're making them do all the work. They have to figure out who you serve, what problem you solve, and who in their network fits. That's too much cognitive load. The introduction never happens. But when you say "do you know any general contractors in Bellevue who are frustrated with their project scheduling?" your advocate can immediately think of a specific person. Specificity is a gift to the person introducing you.

### Key Points to Cover

- Show a bad ask vs. a good ask, side by side. Make it visceral.
- Explain why vague asks fail: cognitive load on the introducer, no mental "hook" to grab onto.
- The "one-sentence ask" framework: I'm looking for [specific role] in [specific industry or area] who is dealing with [specific problem].
- How to prepare your ask before a networking meeting, not wing it.
- Real example from BNI or local Kirkland/Bellevue networking.
- Why being specific doesn't limit your opportunities, it focuses them. You're not asking for fewer introductions, you're asking for better ones.

### Geographic References

Reference Kirkland, Bellevue, Redmond, Seattle naturally. Example: "At my BNI chapter in the Kirkland-Bellevue area, I've watched members go from zero introductions to three a week just by changing how they ask."

### Length

1200-1800 words.

### Style Notes

- Open with a scene: a networking meeting where someone gives a vague ask and gets blank stares.
- Contrast with someone who gives a specific ask and gets three introductions.
- Use dialogue where possible. Make the reader hear the difference.
- Avoid abstract theory. This is nuts and bolts.
